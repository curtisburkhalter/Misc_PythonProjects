# Misc_PythonProjects
This repository contains miscellaneous projects that I've begun using Python. 

The first project contained within this repo is an exploration of wildlife trade using data from the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). The data only includes records from 2016 and 2017 so is somewhat limited, but does provide a nice dataset with which to practice basic Python concepts. 

Further projects to come.
